# 100daysofcode

For my 100 days of code I will be focusing on two things: 
1) Grokking the coding interview design patterns.
2) Building a kernel for a raspberry pi 0.
	1) When finished move on to making a kernel for the Visionfive 2 RISC-V board.

My main focus is to understand the design patterns for coding interview questions. My plan for understanding coding question patterns:
1) Skip straight to solution and fully understand the design pattern.
2) When finishing with a design pattern go back to questions and solve them without looking at solutions.

My other focus is more of a personal project of understanding how a kernel works. My plan:
1) Build binutils
2) Build gcc
3) Build the cross compiler on an Ubuntu machine.
